# Part 2: Communicating with the server

> This is the second part of the introduction to React. First, we take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, we look at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.
