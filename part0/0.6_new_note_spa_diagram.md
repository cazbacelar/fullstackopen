    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    
    Note right of browser: spa.js contains an event handler to handle the form's submit event, which prevents the default handling of form's submit, creates a new note, adds it to the notes list, rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server
    
    Note right of browser: This POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note as JSON data containing both the content of the note and the timestamp
    Note right of browser: The Content-Type header of the request tells the server that the included data is represented in JSON format
    
    server-->>browser: HTTP status code 201 Created
    deactivate server
    
    Note right of server: The HTTP status code 201 means the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one new note being created
    Note right of server: The server does not ask for a redirect, the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests
